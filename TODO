* Next up:
- Make chrome extension notice when we've already imported a page. 
- Make chrome extension "helper" view

- Improve autoparsing
  -> Build proper testing framework for looking at import and parser w/o having
     to wait for extension reloads
     -> Test our node address handler -- it seems like we're managing to double
        or triple import the same stuff when automatically parsing, and if we
        could clear that up, it would be much better.

- Consider automated test of recipe editing -- it seems really easy to
  screw up the state handling so the save/revert buttons don't show
  up. (speaking of - we broke recipe editing state updates again
  somehow???)  (YES -- just broke sidebar w/ a recipe change by accident. Worth
  automated testing of these components with empty state / bad data / good data)
  -> Note: I've built a framework for testing the recipe widget simply enough
  -> Testing save/edit buttons involves either having or mocking state and store
     which is rather a pain...


TODO:
- Finish "Sharing" code (x)
  -> Check if recipe is marked "shared" before showing it (x)
  -> Implement "Share" button to make it shared (x)
  -> Handle multiple recipes / collections (x)

- Fix import of frustrating NYT ingredients with multiple units... (x)
- Set up stable and testing branch w/ launch? (x)

- Refactor / Use typescript???



- Copy recipe button... (x)
- While we're at it... maybe clean up the API issue... (x)
- Consider renaming the 400 things called "api" to something nicer. While you're at it, split code a bit
  so files like remoteApi.js are less overwhelming. (x)

- Import tweaks

- Speed up loading of recipe page (x)

- Fix Log-In and Auto-Sync process (?)
- Fix empty/startup state  (x)
- Create start/login page for chrome extension + app
- Test Syncing from local to cloud... 


Maybe before publish?
- Simple export to file functionality (back-up) (part-way...)
- Allow pushing parsers from web-app to chrome extension so we don't have to update chrome extension (?)

- Create simple "sharing" interface -- "sharing" a recipe makes the
  link public -- when people follow the link they get a recipe they
  can copy to their DB (we strip the _ID and owner from it when
  downloading...?) (x)
  => Flag to be public or not
  => Links to public recipes work for anyone
  => You can add a recipe?
     => recipes as ingredients get added recursively
  => Copy recipe ability... (x)
  

Quick Fix:
-> grams / second unit import (NYTimes!!!) (x)


- Publish version 1


- Fix sorting in firefox?

Wishlist / Next version
- Update routing so back buttons work to move you from e.g. recipe list to open recipe to shopping list
- Save "purchased" state of shopping list items 
- Tweak layout on mobile.

Future
- i18n
- Look into FF extension/other browser extensions


- Consider moving more work to webworkers? e.g. recipe parsing?

- Set up DEV version + Stable version (???)
- Nutrition!
