Ok -- we got a good ways toward building a Gourmet React and now I
think it's time to possibly give that up and start anew in svelte + a
new DB. The real issue was the backend DB was driving me bonkers.

So, what would the new architecture look like?

UI
- Widgets
- Style
- Main
- Browser Extension

BACKEND
- lambda function interface? Let's just go in on netlify and use faunadb? As a temporary measure? Try to define an agnostic API for making calls...
- Handle syncing?

Proper Tests from the ground up...
-> Jest?
-> Maybe we'll mock the backend before we bother building it legitimately?
